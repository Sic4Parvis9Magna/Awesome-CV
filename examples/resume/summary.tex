Backend engineer with more than 5 years of experience in developing and enhancing cloud-based solutions with microservice architecture. Participated in projects from different business domains like "Business Information \& Media", "Energy", "Life Sciences \& Healthcare", and "Software \& Hi-Tech" as well as worked together with international teams.

In my work, I love the most 3 things: teamplay, learning, and puzzles.
 I enjoy helping colleagues and sharing knowledge as well as being on the receiving side. Learning new technologies, tools, and methodologies make my work interesting even after all these years. As for the puzzlers,
 it is always an opportunity to look at things from the new side as well as make new contacts.
